# machine-learning

The machine-learning repository is just an example of a few small machine learning projects that I have tried to work on. 
These project ideas have been inspired by the projects given in the book "Hands-On Machine Learning With Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow" by AurÈlien GÈron as well as a few other ones all around the internet.
